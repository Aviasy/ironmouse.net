<textarea>I am hanging in the bathroom at the biggest party of the fall
I could stay right here or disappear
And nobody'd even notice at all

I'm a creeper in a bathroom 'cause my buddy kinda left me alone
But I'd rather fake pee than stand awkwardly
Or pretend to check a text on my phone

Everything felt fine
When I was half of a pair
And through no fault of mine
There's no other half there

Now I'm just

Mousey in the bathroom
Mousey in the bathroom watching hentai
Forget how long its been
I'm just Mousey in the bathroom

Mousey in the bathroom watching hentai
No, you can't come in
I'm waiting it out 'til it's time to leave
And picking at grout as I softly grieve
	
I'm just
Mousey who you don't know
Mousey flying solo
Mousey in the bathroom by yourself
All by yourself

I am hiding,
But he's out there
Just ignoring all our history
Memories get erased
And I'll get replaced
With a newer cooler version of me

And I hear a drunk girl
Singing along to Whitney through the door
"I wanna dance with somebody!"
And my feelings sink
Cause it makes me think
Now there's no one to make fun of drunk girls with anymore

Now it's just
Mousey in the bathroom
Mousey in the bathroom watching hentai
I half regret the beers
Mousey in the bathroom
Mousey in the bathroom watching hentai
As I choke back the tears
I'll wait as long as I need
'Til my face is dry
Or I'll just blame it on weed
Or something in my eye

I'm just Mousey 
Who you don't know
Mousey flying solo
Mousey in the bathroom by yourself

Knock, knock, knock, knock
They're gonna start to shout soon
Knock, knock, knock, knock
Ah hell yeah I'll be out soon
Knock, knock, knock, knock
It sucks he left me here alone
Knock, knock, knock, knock
Here in this pervert battlezone

Clang, clang, clang, clang
I feel the pressure blowing up
Bang, bang, bang, bang
My big mistake was showing up
Splash, splash, splash, splash
Oh shit I threw some water in my face
And I am in a better place
I go to open up the door

But I can't hear knocking
Anymore

And I can't help but yearn
For a different time
And then I look in the mirror
And the present is clear
And there's no denying

I'm just

*sobbing sounds* ... at a party
Is there a sadder sight

*mumbling sound*
Mousey in the bathroom watching hentai
This is a heinous night
I wish I stayed at home in bed
Watching tentacle porn
Or wish I offed myself instead
Wish I was never born

I'm Mousey
Who's a loner
So she must be a stoner
Riding *awkward giggle* Cruiser
God she's such a loser
Mousey flying solo
Who you think that you know
Mousey in the bathroom by yourself

All by yourself
All by yourself

All you know about me 
Is my name
Awesome party
i'm so glad I came</textarea>
