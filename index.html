<textarea><p>I am hanging in the bathroom at the biggest party of the fall<br>
I could stay right here or disappear<br>
And nobody'd even notice at all<br>
<br>
I'm a creeper in a bathroom 'cause my buddy kinda left me alone<br>
But I'd rather fake pee than stand awkwardly<br>
Or pretend to check a text on my phone<br>
<br>
Everything felt fine<br>
When I was half of a pair<br>
And through no fault of mine<br>
There's no other half there<br>
<br>
Now I'm just<br><br>
<br>
Mousey in the bathroom<br>
Mousey in the bathroom watching hentai<br>
Forget how long its been<br>
I'm just Mousey in the bathroom<br>
<br>
Mousey in the bathroom watching hentai<br>
No, you can't come in<br>
I'm waiting it out 'til it's time to leave<br>
And picking at grout as I softly grieve<br>
<br>
I'm just<br>
Mousey who you don't know<br>
Mousey flying solo<br>
Mousey in the bathroom by yourself<br>
All by yourself<br>
<br>
I am hiding,<br>
But he's out there<br>
Just ignoring all our history<br>
Memories get erased<br>
And I'll get replaced<br>
With a newer cooler version of me<br>
<br>
And I hear a drunk girl<br>
Singing along to Whitney through the door<br>
"I wanna dance with somebody!"<br>
And my feelings sink<br>
Cause it makes me think<br>
Now there's no one to make fun of drunk girls with anymore<br>
<br>
Now it's just<br>
Mousey in the bathroom<br>
Mousey in the bathroom watching hentai<br>
I half regret the beers<br>
Mousey in the bathroom<br>
Mousey in the bathroom watching hentai<br>
As I choke back the tears<br>
I'll wait as long as I need<br>
'Til my face is dry<br>
Or I'll just blame it on weed<br>
Or something in my eye<br>
<br>
I'm just Mousey <br>
Who you don't know<br>
Mousey flying solo<br>
Mousey in the bathroom by yourself<br>
<br>
Knock, knock, knock, knock<br>
They're gonna start to shout soon<br>
Knock, knock, knock, knock<br>
Ah hell yeah I'll be out soon<br>
Knock, knock, knock, knock<br>
It sucks he left me here alone<br>
Knock, knock, knock, knock<br>
Here in this pervert battlezone<br>
<br>
Clang, clang, clang, clang<br>
I feel the pressure blowing up<br>
Bang, bang, bang, bang<br>
My big mistake was showing up<br>
Splash, splash, splash, splash<br>
Oh shit I threw some water in my face<br>
And I am in a better place<br>
I go to open up the door<br>
<br>
But I can't hear knocking<br>
Anymore<br>
<br>
And I can't help but yearn<br>
For a different time<br>
And then I look in the mirror<br>
And the present is clear<br>
And there's no denying<br>
<br>
I'm just<br>
<br>
*sobbing sounds* ... at a party<br>
Is there a sadder sight<br>
than
*mumbling sound*<br>
Mousey in the bathroom watching hentai<br>
This is a heinous night<br>
I wish I stayed at home in bed<br>
Watching tentacle porn<br>
Or wish I offed myself instead<br>
Wish I was never born<br>
<br>
I'm Mousey
Who's a loner<br>
So she must be a stoner<br>
Riding *awkward giggle* Cruiser<br>
God she's such a loser<br>
Mousey flying solo<br>
Who you think that you know<br>
Mousey in the bathroom by yourself<br>
<br>
All by yourself<br>
All by yourself<br>
<br>
All you know about me <br>
Is my name<br>
Awesome party
i'm so glad I came</p><br></textarea>
